-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS happy_devs;

-- Create a table called happy_devs
	-- include columns for:
  	-- an id
  		-- set this column to automatically add values
  	-- name
    -- coffee drinker
    -- lines of code written
    -- date inserted (challenge!)
    	-- set this column to automatically add values
      
 -- Insert 4 rows for your coding peers
 
 -- Insert a row for our buddy Sammy
   -- Make up values for Sammy (except for name)
   
 -- We have another buddy Sammy. 
 -- Let's add them to the table with their own values.
 
 -- Let's practice selecting certain rows.
   -- Use WHERE (combine with =, >, between, in)
   
 -- The first Sammy says we got their name wrong. 
 -- Let's update it.
 
 -- The second Sammy says we got punked and they were the only Sammy all along.
 -- Let's delete that joker.
 
 -- All the happy devs have graduated and want their info cleared.
 -- (Challenge) Let's clear our table without deleting it.
   -- Do this without using the DELETE keyword.
   
 -- On second thought, we'll just get rid of our table.
 -- Get rid of our table.
